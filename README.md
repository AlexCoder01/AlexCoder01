# About Me
## Hi there ðŸ™Œ

I'm Alejandro but I prefer to be called Alex. I live in Mexico and I'm a student of Systems Engineering and Digital Business. I'm in my fifth semester and I really enjoy my career. I discovered the world of web programming when I was in secondary school. I started with HTML, CSS, and JS. I've always considered myself to be creative and innovative, but there's always room for improvement and more learning.
